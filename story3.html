            Okay, now she already knew where to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            She almost run through the stairs, she hurried to her car, she went in and started driving…
            <br>
            <br>
            She felt lighter already…
            <br>
            <br>
            … this time she knew what she was doing.
            <br>
            <br>
            She headed to her usual parking space, she left the car in that grey spot, almost abandoning it there, that empty it looked without her questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            She rushed through the door, she nodded a vague greeting to Paul, and she slid into the back garden.
            <br>
            <br>
            “There she goes’ - smiled Paul.
            <br>
            <br>
            It was like a call, a compulsion… she had to go back there!
            <br>
            <br>
            She saw it there, her tree, cautiously moved some broken branches placed by the roots, and again, she saw the opening, and cautiously she fit herself in.
            <br>
            <br>
            One, two, three… there she goes, into the womb of the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            It just takes a second of breath holding… and she falls down down down, through the roots of the earth, and of herself.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Phew, finally home” - she whispers to herself.
            <br>
            <br>
            There, time has not time, no constraints. She feels so free.
            <br>
            <br>
            She brought a question with her.
            <br>
            <br>
            She walks  so slowly now, with a sense of sacredness (one cannot have a sacred attitude into the land of possibilities!).
            <br>
            <br>
            She heads to the wishing well, she then places her question at the heart of it, and waits…
            <br>
            <br>
            She waits, and waits a bit more…
            <br>
            <br>
            Nothing seems to happen.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then, all of a sudden the sun starts to rise, in all its majesty. She knows she is ready now.
            <br>
            <br>
            She quickly but happily comes back to the surface, and she finds him still there, Paul, wiping the last few glasses.
            <br>
            <br>
            She stared straight into his eyes. Not even a word. Closed silence.
            <br>
            <br>
            “I knew you would find me soon or later”.
            -He said.
