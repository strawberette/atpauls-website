            He was so tired, the road ahead kept swallowing kilometres of light in front of him, into the night…
            <br>
            <br>
            And the night was everywhere, a canvas to his journey, and possibilities… 
            <br>
            <br>
            The lights? Just distractions, highlighting the purpose of the darkness, focus, and directions… right into his destiny, and destination.
            <br>
            <br>
            The wheel, his instrument, the extension of his will.
            <br>
            <br>
            So painful, into the night, and yet so tired, and in need of a real break.
            <br>
            <br>
            From the horizon of the almighty road a luminous sign interrupts his thoughts: “At Paul’s”, it recites.
            <br>
            <br>
            That place materialised as if it came right out of his mind… and there he was, in front of the entrance door, weirdly fascinated by it.
            <br>
            <br>
            So he goes in, not too many ceremonies, just a simple “Hi”. Paul was there, as always, to contain people’s streams of thoughts, to allow them to feel, to surprise them even, with the transparency of their being…
            <br>
            <br>
            Meeting the man was always a sacred encounter for everyone, like meeting someone able to reflect your own soul, and give it back to you, healed, restored, anew…
            <br>
            <br>
            Then, he saw her, sitting alone and lonely at the counter, probably seeking her own answers, or the right questions to ask to herself…
            <br>
            <br>
            It was weird how time felt like it stopped there… A hiccup, a world in apnea, just for as long as you need to find yourself again.
            <br>
            <br>
            He sat at a table just behind the counter… he picked up the menu, just to find out it was empty, nothing was on it, except for a mirror…
            <br>
            <br>
            Before he could even lift his head, and ask for explanations Paul was already there, by his side, serving him the drink he had just prepared for him.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Drink it slowly” - he advises.
            <br>
            <br>
            Soon after he was there alone, again, sitting only in the company of his own drink, and of his own self.
            <br>
            <br>
            The liquid in the glass reflected the light of the moon filtering through the little sky window, which was perfectly framed into the unconventional ceiling of that place.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of a sudden that light started to melt, and evaporate into light breaths…
            <br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, his own self presence started to silently become more solid, more present… as some sort of affirmative kiss between a man, and his own story, the first time they make peace.
            <br>
            <br>
            And while the moonlight kept melting into his cup, so his painful memories and feelings were becoming more soluble, digestible, bearable…
            <br>
            <br>
            He kept looking straight at the night, the hands firmly placed on the wheel… and there he went, into the light.
