            "At Paul's" is a series of short stories written during lockdown by Noemi Scotellaro
            as a way to channel her passion for creative writing, for therapy and for cocktails.
            Noemi's philosophy states that one drink is enough, as long as it's the right one, and its effects might last a lifetime!
            <br>
            <br>
            What's more therapeutic that meeting a luminous sign into the night, on the street, in the middle of nowhere, and having a drink
            that instead of making you forgetting, it's making you more aware? -she thought-  this is how it all started!
            <br>
            <br>
            Paul is an imaginary person, almost inspired by a real one, a man who accompanied Noemi along the important journey of becoming
            a therapist... whose name is... Paul in fact!
            <br>
            <br>
            This series of short stories has been written in the warm company of some friends, during the long cold lockdown of the Covid-19 Pandemic, on Zoom.
            "If there's one positive thing I'll remember of those difficult years" - she said- "is that cosy corner in my kitchen, where I would sit on my Sundays
            with some of my dearest friends, and write about roads, and people, and therapeutic drinks."
            <br>
            <br>
            Cheers!
